            </div>
            <div class="overview p-3  ">
                This dataset is originally from the National Institute of IT Technology. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a employee has mental health, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

                Modules in our Project:
            </div> 
            <div class="overview p-3  ">
                <li> Exploratory Data Analysis : It is an approch to analyse the explotary data with visual techninices  it used to trends or patterns with help of the statsical summary and graphically.

                <li> Data Preprocessing : Preprocessing in data mining technique which used to transform the raw data in a useful and efficient manner.
                <li> Feature Engineering : Process of selecting,manipulating,and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning.
                <li> One Hot Encoding : It is a common way of Preprocessing categorical features for machine learning models.
                <li> Base Models : A baseline model is essentically a simple model that acts as a reference in machine learning project .
                <li> Model Tuning : Tuning is the process of maximizing a model's performance without overfitting or creating too high of a variance.
                <li> Comparison of Final Models : It is compared on basics of Time complexity, Space complexity, Sample complexity,Parametricity.
                <li> Reporting : when a client is reported ,their case is first reviewed by our automated Disciplinary System.
